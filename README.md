# javascript-code-quiz

For the fourth weekly challenge, my task was to create an application that used JavaScript to dynamically populate a webpage, in order to build a timed coding quiz. The quiz should feature multiple choice questions, a timer with penalty for wrong answers, and the ability to save your high score after the quiz is over.

All HTML, CSS and JavaScript code for the application, as shown below, was of my own design.
